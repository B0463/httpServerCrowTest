# httpServerCrowTest

A simple HTTP server built with C++ and [Crow](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow).

The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of web servers in C++, as part of a personal transition from using TypeScript to C++ in my own projects.

Maybe this repository will inspire you to explore C++ for your web development needs too!

## How to Run

1. **Install the dependencies**  
    Youâ€™ll need Crow, Asio, Make, and g++ installed on your system.

2. **Compile the project**

    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. **Start the server**

    ```bash
    bin/httpServerCrowTest
    ```
